Steps to Install Packages and Run Server:

1. Install virtualenv 
  https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/
  
2. Install Python2.7 if you do not have it already. 
  https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/
  
3. Install Django1.9 
  pip install Django==1.9
  (If pip command not found, install pip with "sudo easy_install pip")
  
4. Install Postgresql
  brew install postgresql
  (You may have to link postgres if there is an error while installing. You can do this with "brew link postgresql"
  
5. Install pyscopg2
  pip install pyscopg2
  
 
 Now that everything is installed properly (If not message Nick/anyone else for assistance :) ), we are ready to run the server.
 
 If you have not cloned this repo yet, you should do so with "git clone https://github.com/dfaulken/umass-cs-320-django.git".
 
 From there, change directories into umass-cs-320-django and run "Python manage.py runserver".

 In the words of the great Emeril Lagasse, BAM.
